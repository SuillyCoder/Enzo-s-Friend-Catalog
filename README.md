Hello, everyone! Hiya!
I admittedly did not know much about README files way before uploading this project, but now I do. Lmao

This project is one out of two projects that I have made over the Christmas Break in order to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was mostly Javascript heavy since I wanted to practice it even more.

This project involves a lot of dynamic interactivity such as dynamic element changing due to event handling, navigating systems, and even page navigation. 

You can access the project (recently deployed) right over here:

In all honesty, I used a lot of Inner.HTML syntaxes for this because I was changing stuff a lot. 
It was a good thing I learned that can then allow me to dynamically change the elements of a website whenever a user decides to do something. 

Overall, what I have gained from this project is a more in-depth understanding of how event handling works, and how JavaScript helps 
a lot in making websites and pages responsive to the user. 

Of course, my skills are still lacking, as I do not know about React or APIs atm, but I will have to continue to learn about them as time passes by. 

For now, this is one of the many webdev projects that I have dived into and I am hoping to create even more projects later on 
in the future that may allow me to further enhance my programming proficiency.

I am a WebDev newbie with over 5 months and a couple of days worth of experience, so feel free to give any form of comments or feedback
that you may want to tell me so that I may use it to further improve later on in the future!

You've stuck this far; thanks for taking the time to read! :D :D :D
