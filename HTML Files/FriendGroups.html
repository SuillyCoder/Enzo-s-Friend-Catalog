        <h1>The Big Elem Boiz</h1>
        <p>This friend group goes way back, and I mean way way back. This friend group formed during my elementary days and even if we haven’t seen each other and/or talked much, we still keep each other close as best of friends.

        <h1>The Weirdo's Abode</h1>
        <p>This was my prime high school group. What started as “we should make a GC” during Comm1 practice turned into a whole band of brotherly weirdos. They were the people I could breathe safe in whenever I’m around them, and I’m glad to have met them. </p>

        <h1>The Congoer's Abode</h1>
        <p>This one started ever since I met Zoe during Anime Asobi 2022, which then led me to meet a bunch of newer people in the long run. This had people I was familiar with, so I was able to get along with familiar faces, new faces, all with a love for cosplay.

        <h1>Work Immersion Mates</h1>
        <p>I wouldn’t exactly call this a “friend group” but more like a group of people that I’ve eventually come to be comfortable with throughout our many days of interaction. We were stationed in the City Hall (OBO Department) and I’m lucky my coworkers were ones I could get along with.

        <h1>The BukidNerds</h1>
        <p>One of the first friend groups that I managed to form during my first week of college. I never thought I would be able to have an instant friend group from the get-go, but surprisingly, I did, and I’m glad that most of the people within the friend group are able to click.

        <h1>The Dorm-Rades</h1>
        <p>This one was a special friend group made solely because one of my friends had a dorm, and it was open for us to stay and chill inside. Eventually, the friend group progressed , gaining more people, all because of a single dorm.
